<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm an optician working at Costco Optical. I've been working in my current role for one year now and I find it very satisfying. I decided to change careers and become a web developer because it contains all of the skills that I enjoy most about my current job. Most of all having a growth mindset.</p>
