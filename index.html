<h3>About Me</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/JBShaffer91"><img src="good-photo.jpg" alt="a good photo of me"></a>
<p>I'm an optician working at <strong>Costco Optical</strong>. I've been working in my current role for one year now and I find it very satisfying. I decided to change careers and become a <span class="dramatic">web developer</span> because it contains all of the skills that I enjoy most about my current job, but most of all having a growth mindset.</p>

  <h3>Vader's Blog</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/JBShaffer91/Pet-Blog.git"><img src="vader.jpg" alt="Picture of Vader"></a>
<p>This was a very fun project for me simply because I got to praise my dog, and who doesn't <em>love</em> that? This was also my first attempt at HTML and CSS, and I must say I was very pleased with the outcome.</p>
