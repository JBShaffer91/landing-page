<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm an optician working at <strong>Costco Optical</strong>. I've been working in my current role for one year now and I find it very satisfying. I decided to change careers and become a web developer because it contains all of the skills that I enjoy most about my current job, but most of all having a growth mindset.</p>

<p>This was a very fun project for me simply because I got to praise my dog, and who doesn't <em>love</em> that? This was also my first attempt at HTML and CSS, and I must say I was very pleased with the outcome.</p>
