<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm an optician working at Costco Optical. I've been working in my current role for one year now and I find it very satisfying. I decided to change careers and become a web developer because it contains all of the skills that I enjoy most about my current job. Most of all having a growth mindset.</p>

<h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/JBShaffer91/Pet-Blog.git">Vader's Blog</a>
<p>This was a very fun project for me simply because I got to praise my dog, and who doesn't love that? This was also my first attempt at HTML and CSS, and I must say I was very pleased with the outcome.</p>
